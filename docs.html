    <p>
            This simple HTML5 and JavaScript project implements the canvas tag. I have drawn lines, circles, half circles, and fills using JavaScript, 
            referencing the canvas tag. Using jQuery, I have implemented 5 buttons that make the vowels I have drawn on the canvas page appear on the screen.
            The canvas tag is a very powerful tool, yet it takes A LOT of work to draw a simple shape. JavaScript libraries that build ontop of the canvas properities 
            are a better route to go in the long run.
